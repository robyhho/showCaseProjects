<b>Tip Calculator</b> <br> <br>

This is a frontendmentor design and project idea. <br>
The goal of this project was to practice recreating a given design using their logo and color schemes. Testing my css skills by recreating each element as closely as possible.
This project was done in html, css and javascript. <br> 
Another challenge was giving it the functionality desired by the project, 
Implementing the tip calculation part was a good test of utilising button functions and calculating variables behind the scenes, <br>
and displaying the calculated outcome in the html dynamically.
